Parsing expressions
===================

An XPath expression (the *path*) is analyzed using a parser instance,
having as result a tree of tokens:

.. doctest::

    >>> from elementpath import XPath2Parser, XPathToken
    >>>
    >>> parser = XPath2Parser()
    >>> token = parser.parse('/root/(: comment :) child[@attr]')
    >>> isinstance(token, XPathToken)
    True

That token is a proxy token for the tree produced by TDOP parsing:

.. doctest::

    >>> token
    <_SolidusOperator object at 0x...
    >>> str(token)
    "'/' operator"
    >>> token.tree
    '(/ (/ (root)) ([ (child) (@ (attr))))'
    >>> token.source
    '/root/child[@attr]'

Providing a wrong expression an error is raised:

.. doctest::

    >>> token = parser.parse('/root/#child2/@attr')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      .........
    elementpath.exceptions.ElementPathSyntaxError: '#' unknown at line 1, column 7: [err:XPST0003] unknown symbol '#'

The result tree is also checked with a static evaluation, that uses only the information
provided by the parser instance (e.g. statically known namespaces).
In *elementpath* a parser instance represents the
`XPath static context <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-3/#static_context>`_.
Static evaluation is not based on any XML input data but permits to found many errors
related with operators and function arguments:

.. doctest::

    >>> token = parser.parse('1 + "1"')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File ".../elementpath/xpath2/xpath2_parser.py", ..., in parse
        root_token.evaluate()  # Static context evaluation
      .........
    elementpath.exceptions.ElementPathTypeError: '+' operator at line 1, column 3: [err:XPTY0004] ...


Dynamic evaluation
==================

Evaluation on XML data is performed using the
`XPath dynamic context <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-3/#eval_context>`_,
represented by *XPathContext* objects.

.. doctest::

    >>> from xml.etree import ElementTree
    >>> from elementpath import XPathContext
    >>>
    >>> root = ElementTree.XML('<root><child/><child attr="10"/></root>')
    >>> context = XPathContext(root)
    >>> token.evaluate(context)
    [EtreeElementNode(elem=<Element 'child' at ...)]

In this case an error is raised if you don't provide a context:

.. doctest::

    >>> token.evaluate()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      .........
    elementpath.exceptions.MissingContextError: '/' operator at line 1, column 6: [err:XPDY0002] Dynamic context required for evaluate

Expressions that not depend on XML data can be evaluated also without a context:

.. doctest::

    >>> token = parser.parse('concat("foo", " ", "bar")')
    >>> token.evaluate()
    'foo bar'

For more details on parsing and evaluation of XPath expressions see the
`XPath processing model <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-3/#id-processing-model>`_.


Node trees
==========

In the `XPath Data Model <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/>`_
there are `seven kinds of nodes <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/#Nodehave>`_:
document, element, attribute, text, namespace, processing instruction, and comment.

For a fully compliant XPath processing all the seven node kinds have to be represented
and processed, considering theirs properties (called accessors) and their position in
the belonging document.

But the ElementTree components donâ€™t implement all the necessary characteristics,
forcing to use workaround tricks, that make the code more complex.
So since version v3.0 the data processing is based on XPath node types, that act
as wrappers of elements of the input ElementTree structures.
Node trees building requires more time and memory for handling dynamic context and
for iterating the trees, but is overall fast because simplify the rest of the code.

Node trees are automatically created at dynamic context initialization:

.. doctest::

    >>> from xml.etree import ElementTree
    >>> from elementpath import XPathContext, get_node_tree
    >>>
    >>> root = ElementTree.XML('<root><child/><child attr="10"/></root>')
    >>> context = XPathContext(root)
    >>> context.root
    EtreeElementNode(elem=<Element 'root' at ...>)
    >>> context.root.children
    [EtreeElementNode(elem=<Element 'child' at ...>), EtreeElementNode(elem=<Element 'child' at ...>)]

If the same XML data is applied several times for dynamic evaluation it maybe
convenient to build the node tree before, in the way to create it only once:

.. doctest::

    >>> root_node = get_node_tree(root)
    >>> context = XPathContext(root_node)
    >>> context.root is root_node
    True


The context root and the context item
=====================================

Selector functions and class simplify the XML data processing. Often you only
have to provide the root element and the path expression.

But other keyword arguments, related to parser or context initialization, can
be provided. Of these arguments the item has a particular relevance, because it
defines the initial context item for performing dynamic evaluation.

If you have this XML data:

.. doctest::

    >>> from xml.etree import ElementTree
    >>> from elementpath import select
    >>>
    >>> root = ElementTree.XML('<root><child1/><child2/><child3/></root>')

using a select on it with the self-shortcut expression, gives back the root
element:

.. doctest::

    >>> select(root, '.')
    [<Element 'root' at ...>]

But if you want to use a specific child as the initial context item you have
to provide the extra argument *item*:

.. doctest::

    >>> select(root, '.', item=root[1])
    [<Element 'child2' at ...>]

The same result can be obtained providing the same child element as argument *root*:

.. doctest::

    >>> select(root[1], '.')
    [<Element 'child2' at ...>]

But this is not always true, because in the latter case the evaluation is
done using a subtree of nodes:

.. doctest::

    >>> select(root, 'root()', item=root[1])
    [<Element 'root' at ...>]
    >>> select(root[1], 'root()')
    [<Element 'child2' at ...>]

Both choices can be useful, depends if you need to keep the whole tree or
to restrict the scope to a subtree.

The context *item* can be set with an XPath node, an atomic value or an XPath function.

.. note::
    Since release v4.2.0 the *root* is optional. If the argument *root* is absent
    the argument *item* is mandatory and the dynamic context remain without a root.


The root document and the root element
======================================

.. warning::
    The initialization of context root and item is changed in release v4.2.0.

    Since then the provided XML is still considered a document for default, but the
    item is set with the root instead of `None` and the new attribute *document* is
    set with a dummy document for handling the document position. The dummy document
    is not referred by the root element and is discarded from results.

Canonically the dynamic evaluation is performed on an XML document, created
from an ElementTree instance:

.. doctest::

    >>> from xml.etree import ElementTree
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> from elementpath import select, XPathContext
    >>>
    >>> doc = ElementTree.parse(StringIO('<root><child1/><child2/><child3/></root>'))
    >>> doc
    <xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree object at ...>

In this case a document node is created at context initialization and the
context item is set to context root:

.. doctest::

    >>> context = XPathContext(doc)
    >>> context.root
    EtreeDocumentNode(document=<xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree object at ...>)
    >>> context.item is context.root
    True
    >>> context.document is context.root
    True

Providing a root element the document is not created and the context item is
set to root element node. In this case the context document is a dummy document:

.. doctest::

    >>> root = ElementTree.XML('<root><child1/><child2/><child3/></root>')
    >>> context = XPathContext(root)
    >>> context.root
    EtreeElementNode(elem=<Element 'root' at ...>)
    >>> context.item is context.root
    True
    >>> context.document
    EtreeDocumentNode(document=<xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree object at ...>)
    >>> context.root.parent is None
    True

Exception to this is if XML data root has siblings and if you process
the data with lxml:

.. doctest::

    >>> import lxml.etree as etree
    >>> root = etree.XML('<!-- comment --><root><child/></root>')
    >>> context = XPathContext(root)
    >>> context.root
    EtreeDocumentNode(document=<lxml.etree._ElementTree object at ...>)
    >>> context.item is context.root
    True
    >>> context.document is context.root
    True

Provide the option *fragment* with value `True` for processing an XML root element
as a fragment. In this case a dummy document is not created and the context document
is set to `None`:

.. doctest::

    >>> root = ElementTree.XML('<root><child1/><child2/><child3/></root>')
    >>> context = XPathContext(root, fragment=True)
    >>> context.root
    EtreeElementNode(elem=<Element 'root' at ...>)
    >>> context.item is context.root
    True
    >>> context.document is None
    True
